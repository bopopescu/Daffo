# Use of lambda() with filter()

# The filter() function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments.
#  This offers an elegant way to filter out all the elements of a 
#  sequence “sequence”, for which the function returns True.
#   Here is a small program that returns the odd numbers from an input list:
# filter_none

# Python code to illustrate 
# filter() with lambda() 
li = [5, 7, 22, 97, 54, 62, 77, 23, 73, 61] 
final_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 != 0) , li)) 
print(final_list)
