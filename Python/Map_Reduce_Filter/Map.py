# Use of lambda() with map()

# The map() function in Python takes in a function and a list as argument.
#  The function is called with a lambda function and a list and 
#  a new list is returned which contains all the lambda modified items returned 
#  by that function for each item. Example:
# filter_none
# Python code to illustrate  
# map() with lambda()  
# to get double of a list. 
li = [5, 7, 22, 97, 54, 62, 77, 23, 73, 61] 
final_list = list(map(lambda x: x*2 , li)) 
print(final_list)
